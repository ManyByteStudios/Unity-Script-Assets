The following scripts and assets are inspector tools, to validate or help
manage the various variables that a script may have. These attributes can
be used with unity's built in attributes. Only 1 attribte that are not 
from Unity's built in attributes may be used for each variable. Unfortubately
there is no way around this.

Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date!

==============================================================================

All other scritps created by me use these custom attributes. The scripts can 
be modfied to not include the custom attributes. Simply remove the any custom
attribute and remove "using ByteAttribute;" from the script and it will work.

For any script would like to use the custom attributes simply put 
"using ByteAttribute;" at the top of the script.

==============================================================================
