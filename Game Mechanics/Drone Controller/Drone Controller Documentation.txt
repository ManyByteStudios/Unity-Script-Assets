Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "DroneController". If you will have multiple UI bars it
is best to use inheritance.

This script comes with a Scriptable object that contains every variable this script
uses.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

This script requires the following functions to be called in FixedUpdate():
- ForwardMovement(...)
- StrafeMovement(...)
- ElevationChange(...)
- RotateDrone(...)
