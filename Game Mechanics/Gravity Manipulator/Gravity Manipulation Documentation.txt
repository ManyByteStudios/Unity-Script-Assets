Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "GravityManipulator" or "GravityBody".

This set of scripts also come with "GravityManipulator2D" or "GravityBody2D" for a
2D game enviorment. It both fucnctions the same and has the same functions with "2D"
at the end.

The Gravity Body script should be placed on the object that you wish to be affected
by gravity.

The Gravity Manipulator script should be placed on the object that you wish to affect
other objects.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

This script will run itself,
