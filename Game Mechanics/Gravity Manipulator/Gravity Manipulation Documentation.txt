Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import it into the project. Inherit the script and all the functions
are open and ready to be used. This script will require you to overide the start and update functions,
or you may use the "GravityUpdate" method in late update. The properties will require a scriptable object. 
There is already a scriptable object script with everything that is need for the primary script. 
Create a scriptable object and referance it in the inspector with the desired script.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.
