Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "HoverPhysics".

This script comes with a Scriptable object that contains every variable this script
uses.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

Hover() must be called during FixedUpdate() and is the core logic and function of the script.
AllowHover() will toggle on or off the hover state.
