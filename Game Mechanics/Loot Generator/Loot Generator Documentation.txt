Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "LootGenerator".

This script comes with a Scriptable object that contains every variable this script
uses.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

GenerateLoot(...) is the only method that is needed to be called. If the script has many
different loot object and chances, the script will run slower.
