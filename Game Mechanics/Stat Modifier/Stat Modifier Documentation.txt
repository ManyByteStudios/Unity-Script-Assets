 Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "StatModifier".

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

Calling the methods SaveStats(), LoadStats(), and ClearStats(), will store and grab any data that 
are saved in Player Prefs, the ClearStats() will deleted any Player prefs stats relating to the
modifier. These methods will only work if the modifier name variable is filled.

Calling UpgradeModifier(...), will level up the stat modifier similar to the mods in
Warframe.

StatResults will return the value of the stat, based on the modifier type addative will return
the exact value while percentage will return the value / 100. The FinalStatDescription is
a string that is accessible in another class to get the description and stat of the stat.
