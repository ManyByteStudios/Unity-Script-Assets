Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "TimeManipulator".

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

Calling the method SetTimeScale(float NewTimeScale) will change the time scale speed
in unity to the desired speed. Please note that the time scale cannot go lower than 0.

Calling the method GetTimeScale() returns the current time scale in Unity.

Calling the method LerpTimeScale(float SmoothSpeed, float NewTimeScale) will gradually
change the time scale speed in Unity to the desired speed.
