Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "UniversalTimer".

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

Calling the methods SwitchTimerFunction(...), SetTimerCountUp(), and SetTimerCountDown, 
will change the type of timer function. 

Calling the method ResetTimer(...), will pause and reset the timer based on its function.
While calling PauseUnpauseTimer() will change the active status on the timer function.

RunTimer() must be called during the Update method, it is the core function and logic of the
script. TimerText() will return a string of the of the timer and will display accordingly
of counting up and down.
