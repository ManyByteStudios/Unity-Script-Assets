Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "UniversalUIBar". If you will have multiple UI bars it
is best to use inheritance.

This script comes with a Scriptable object that contains every variable this script
uses.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

Calling the method GetCurrentFill() will return the percentage that the UI bar is filled. 

Calling the method SetCurrentFill(float SetFill) will change the current fill amount.

Calling the Fill_UI_Bar(float FillAmount) will gradually fill or empty the bar based on amount
provided.
