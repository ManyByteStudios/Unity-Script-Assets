Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "DontDestroy".

This script simply allows for only a single instance of any given object with this
script. This script also allows for scripts that inherit this class to act in the 
same manner, and can transition between different scenes.
